# keystone-operator

Test kuttl Test

A Kubernetes Operator built using the [Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework) for Go. The Operator provides a way to easily install and manage an OpenStack Keystone installation
on Kubernetes. This Operator was developed using [TCIB](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/tcib/blob/main/container-images/containers.yaml) containers for OpenStack.

# Deployment

The operator is intended to be deployed via OLM [Operator Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager)

# API Example

The Operator creates a custom KeystoneAPI resource that can be used to create Keystone API
instances within the cluster. Example CR to create an Keystone API in your cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: keystone.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: KeystoneAPI
metadata:
  name: keystone
spec:
  containerImage: quay.io/podified-antelope-centos9/openstack-keystone:current-podified
  replicas: 1
  secret: osp-secret
```

## Example: configure Keystone with additional networks

The Keystone spec can be used to configure Keystone to have the pods
being attached to additional networks.

Create a network-attachement-definition which then can be referenced
from the Keystone API CR.

```
---
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: storage
  namespace: openstack
spec:
  config: |
    {
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "name": "storage",
      "type": "macvlan",
      "master": "enp7s0.21",
      "ipam": {
        "type": "whereabouts",
        "range": "172.18.0.0/24",
        "range_start": "172.18.0.50",
        "range_end": "172.18.0.100"
      }
    }
```

The following represents an example of Keystone resource that can be used
to trigger the service deployment, and have the service pods attached to
the storage network using the above NetworkAttachmentDefinition.

```
apiVersion: keystone.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: KeystoneAPI
metadata:
  name: keystone
spec:
  ...
  networkAttachents:
  - storage
...
```

When the service is up and running, it will now have an additional nic
configured for the storage network:

```
# oc rsh keystone-75f5cd6595-kpfr2
sh-5.1# ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: eth0@if298: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 0a:58:0a:82:01:18 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 10.130.1.24/23 brd 10.130.1.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::4cf2:a3ff:feb0:932/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
4: net1@if26: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether a2:f1:3b:12:fd:be brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.18.0.52/24 brd 172.18.0.255 scope global net1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::a0f1:3bff:fe12:fdbe/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

## Example: expose Keystone to an isolated network

The Keystone spec can be used to configure Keystone to register e.g.
the internal endpoint to an isolated network. MetalLB is used for this
scenario.

As a pre requisite, MetalLB needs to be installed and worker nodes
prepared to work as MetalLB nodes to serve the LoadBalancer service.

In this example the following MetalLB IPAddressPool is used:

```
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: osp-internalapi
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 172.17.0.200-172.17.0.210
  autoAssign: false
```

The following represents an example of Keystone resource that can be used
to trigger the service deployment, and have the internal keystoneAPI endpoint
registerd as a MetalLB service using the IPAddressPool `osp-internal`,
request to use the IP `172.17.0.202` as the VIP and the IP is shared with
other services.

```
apiVersion: keystone.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: KeystoneAPI
metadata:
  name: keystone
spec:
  ...
  externalEndpoints:
  - endpoint: internal
    ipAddressPool: osp-internalapi
    loadBalancerIPs:
    - 172.17.0.202
    sharedIP: true
    sharedIPKey: ""
  ...
...
```

The internal keystone endpoint gets registered with its service name. This
service name needs to resolve to the `LoadBalancerIP` on the isolated network
either by DNS or via /etc/hosts:

```
# openstack endpoint list -c 'Service Name' -c Interface -c URL --service keystone
+--------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Service Name | Interface | URL                                                             |
+--------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| keystone     | public    | http://keystone-public-openstack.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org |
| keystone     | internal  | http://keystone-internal.openstack.svc:5000                     |
+--------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

# Design
The current design takes care of the following:

- Creates keystone config files via config maps
- Creates a keystone deployment with the specified replicas
- Creates a keystone service
- Generates Fernet keys (TODO: rotate them, and bounce the APIs upon rotation)
- Keystone bootstrap, and db sync are executed automatically on install and updates
- ConfigMap is recreated on any changes KeystoneAPI object changes and the Deployment updated.
